# ci-light-bulb üí°

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/screendriver/ci-light-bulb.svg?branch=github)](https://travis-ci.org/screendriver/ci-light-bulb)

---

A Web App that connects [GitHub Statuses API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/)
to a smart light bulb over
[Web Bluetooth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API).

The bulb changes the color automatically according to the curret build status:

* Yellow when one of the builds are currently running
* Red when of the builds failed
* Green when all builds are successful
* Pink when the build state is unknown (this should always indicate a bug üêõ
  in the App)
